// Workaround for assignedTeam not working as desired in 1.60 (team assignments
// are not broadcast in MP)
//
// The workaround is pretty grotty, but enough people asked for this feature
// that I'll just Deal With It.
//
// The basic jist is that the group's leader client will watch for changes to
// assigned teams and broadcast them.
// Everyone uses a wrapped version of assignedTeam which fetches the "shared"
// version of this value.
//
// Subtleties to look out for:
// - Leader of group changes -> Copy the "shared" data to the engine before
//   checking for changes.
// - Someone else joining your group -> discard their assigned team
// - Joining an existing group -> discard your own, everyone else discards too
//
// We don't call assignTeam "locally" unless we're the group leader because
// if the command is fixed to broadcast changes in multiplayer, you'll get
// every group member broadcasting to everyone else until an update can be
// pushed out to every user of STHud.
//
// As a minor optimisation, most of this code doesn't execute in singleplayer.
